# ðŸ§  Loan Default Risk Prediction System

This project predicts loan default using Machine Learning (Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (LSTM), with a Streamlit-based web UI.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload your data or predict live
- Visual comparison of models
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, loss chart
- Model auto-downloads if not found

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Random Forest (hosted on Google Drive âœ…)
- Naive Bayes
- LSTM 

## ðŸ”§ Model Files

All trained models, scalers, and evaluation files are included directly in this project folder.

- `naive_bayes_model.pkl`
- `lstm_model.h5`
- `conf_matrix_rf.pkl`, etc.

No external downloads required âœ…


## ðŸ“¥ How to Run
